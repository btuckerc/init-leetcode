## Initialize a Problem
Run `chmod +x init_problem`

And when you're ready to solve a problem, `./init_problem <problem_number>`. This automatically creates a directory, and fetches the problem name.

## Common Problem Types

Understanding and categorizing problems is essential for effective problem-solving. Below is a list of common problem types, along with a brief description and example links.
